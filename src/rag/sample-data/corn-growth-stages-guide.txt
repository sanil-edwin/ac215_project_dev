# Corn Growth Stages and Critical Management Periods
## Iowa Corn Production Guide

## Overview of Corn Development

Iowa's corn growing season typically runs from May 1 to October 31, spanning approximately 26 weeks. Understanding growth stages is essential for timing management decisions and interpreting stress impacts.

## Vegetative Stages

### VE - Emergence
- Occurs 4-14 days after planting depending on soil temperature
- Coleoptile emerges from soil surface
- Critical for stand establishment
- Soil temperature >50°F required for germination

### V1-V3 - Early Seedling
- Growing point still below soil surface
- Root system developing
- Leaf tips visible, counting from first rounded leaf
- Plant can recover from minor frost damage

### V4-V6 - Rapid Growth Initiation
- Growing point moves above soil surface
- Nodal root system becoming primary
- Ear shoot initiation begins
- **V6: Kernel row number determined**

### V7-V10 - Rapid Vegetative Growth
- Plant height increasing rapidly
- Leaf area expanding significantly
- Nutrient demand increasing
- Potential kernels per row being set

### V11-V15 - Late Vegetative
- Maximum leaf number reached
- **V12-V15: Kernel number per row finalized**
- Tassel development beginning
- Water demand increasing sharply

### VT - Tasseling
- Tassel fully emerged and visible
- Last branch of tassel completely emerged
- Pollen shed begins 2-3 days after VT
- Plant at maximum height

## Reproductive Stages

### R1 - Silking
- Silks visible outside husks
- **MOST CRITICAL stage for yield determination**
- Pollination occurring
- Maximum water demand period

### R2 - Blister
- Kernels white on outside, clear fluid inside
- About 85% moisture
- Embryo beginning to develop
- Still susceptible to severe stress

### R3 - Milk
- Kernels yellow outside, milky white fluid inside
- About 80% moisture
- Rapid starch accumulation beginning
- Embryo clearly visible

### R4 - Dough
- Kernels have dough-like consistency
- About 70% moisture
- Starch accumulation rapid
- Four milk lines visible on kernel

### R5 - Dent
- All kernels dented
- About 55% moisture
- Starch accumulation slowing
- Kernel milk line moving toward tip

### R6 - Physiological Maturity
- Black layer formed at kernel tip
- Maximum dry weight achieved
- About 30-35% moisture
- No further yield accumulation possible

## Critical Periods for Stress Impact

### Week of Season Reference (May 1 = Week 1)

| Week | Growth Stage | Critical Event | Stress Sensitivity |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1-4 | Planting | Stand establishment | Moderate |
| 5-6 | V3-V6 | Root development | Moderate |
| 7-8 | V6-V8 | Kernel rows set | High |
| 9-10 | V10-V14 | Kernels/row set | High |
| 11-12 | VT-R1 | Pollination | CRITICAL |
| 13-14 | R2-R3 | Early grain fill | High |
| 15-18 | R4-R5 | Grain fill | Moderate-High |
| 19-22 | R5-R6 | Maturation | Low-Moderate |

## Water Demand by Stage

### Daily Water Use (inches/day)
- Emergence to V8: 0.10-0.15
- V8 to VT: 0.20-0.30
- VT to R2: 0.30-0.35 (PEAK)
- R2 to R5: 0.25-0.30
- R5 to R6: 0.15-0.20

### Total Seasonal Requirement
- Full season corn: 20-25 inches
- Peak 30-day period: 9-10 inches

## Nutrient Uptake Timing

### Nitrogen
- 60-70% taken up by silking
- Rapid uptake V10-R2
- Deficiency visible as V-shaped yellowing of lower leaves

### Phosphorus
- 50% taken up by silking
- Critical for early root development
- Deficiency shows as purple coloration

### Potassium
- 70-80% taken up by silking
- Important for stalk strength
- Deficiency shows as marginal leaf scorch

## Heat Unit Accumulation

### Growing Degree Days (GDD)
- Base temperature: 50°F
- Maximum temperature cap: 86°F
- Formula: GDD = (Max + Min)/2 - 50

### GDD Requirements by Stage
| Stage | Cumulative GDD |
|-------|---------------|
| VE | 100-120 |
| V6 | 450-500 |
| V12 | 800-900 |
| VT | 1100-1200 |
| R1 | 1200-1350 |
| R6 | 2400-2800 |

## Management Timing Guidelines

### Pre-Plant (Before May 1)
- Soil testing and fertility planning
- Hybrid selection based on maturity zone
- Tillage and seedbed preparation

### Planting (Week 1-3)
- Optimal soil temp >50°F
- Plant population decisions
- Starter fertilizer application

### Early Season (Week 4-7)
- Stand counts and replant decisions
- Post-emergence herbicide timing
- Sidedress nitrogen application

### Mid-Season (Week 8-12)
- Scouting for insects and diseases
- Irrigation decisions (if applicable)
- Fungicide timing (VT-R1)

### Late Season (Week 13-22)
- Yield estimation
- Harvest timing decisions
- Moisture monitoring

### Harvest (Week 20-26)
- Target moisture: 15-20% for grain
- Monitor test weight
- Adjust combine settings

## Stress Interaction Effects

### Heat + Drought Combination
- More damaging than either stress alone
- Accelerates vegetative development
- Shortens grain fill period
- Increases pollen desiccation risk

### Nutrient Deficiency + Drought
- Drought limits nutrient uptake
- Potassium deficiency common during drought
- Nitrogen deficiency worsens stress symptoms

### Disease + Stress
- Stressed plants more susceptible to:
  - Gray leaf spot
  - Northern corn leaf blight
  - Stalk rots
  - Ear rots

## Iowa-Specific Considerations

### Northern Iowa (CRDs 1-3)
- Shorter growing season
- Earlier planting when possible
- Earlier maturity hybrids
- Higher yield potential in good years

### Central Iowa (CRDs 4-6)
- Optimal growing conditions
- Full-season hybrids perform well
- Highest yield potential region

### Southern Iowa (CRDs 7-9)
- Variable soil quality
- More drought prone
- Shorter hybrids may be appropriate
- Consider stress tolerance
