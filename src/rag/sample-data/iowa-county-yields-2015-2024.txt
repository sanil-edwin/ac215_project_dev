4. Drought years (like 2012, 2020) show dramatic yield reductions

### Climate Impact Examples
- 2020 derecho caused significant damage in Central Iowa
- 2018 saw reduced yields in northern counties due to wet spring
- 2024 was a record year for many counties

### County-Level Planning
- Use 10-year averages for conservative estimates
