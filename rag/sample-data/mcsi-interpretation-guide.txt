# AgriGuard MCSI: Understanding Multivariate Corn Stress Index
## Technical Guide for Stress Interpretation

## Overview

The Multivariate Corn Stress Index (MCSI) is a composite indicator that combines multiple environmental and vegetation measurements to provide a comprehensive assessment of corn crop health across Iowa's 99 counties.

## MCSI Components

### 1. NDVI Index (Vegetation Health)
**Source**: MODIS satellite imagery (MOD13A1.061)
**Resolution**: 500 meters, 16-day composite
**What it measures**: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index - vegetation greenness and density

**Interpretation**:
- Values range from -1 to 1 (raw NDVI)
- Converted to 0-100 index scale for MCSI
- Higher values = healthier, denser vegetation
- Peak values typically occur during silking stage (weeks 10-12)

**NDVI Thresholds for Corn**:
| Raw NDVI | Index Score | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| >0.75 | 90-100 | Excellent canopy |
| 0.60-0.75 | 70-89 | Good health |
| 0.45-0.60 | 50-69 | Moderate stress |
| 0.30-0.45 | 30-49 | Significant stress |
| <0.30 | 0-29 | Severe stress/bare soil |

### 2. LST Index (Heat Stress)
**Source**: MODIS satellite imagery (MOD11A2.061)
**Resolution**: 1 km, 8-day composite
**What it measures**: Land Surface Temperature - canopy and soil thermal conditions

**Interpretation**:
- Raw values in Kelvin, converted to Celsius
- Index inverted: lower temperature = higher score
- Critical threshold: 32°C (90°F) for pollination stress

**LST Index Conversion**:
| Temperature (°C) | Index Score | Stress Level |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------|
| <25 | 90-100 | Optimal (cool) |
| 25-30 | 70-89 | Normal |
| 30-35 | 50-69 | Moderate heat |
| 35-40 | 30-49 | High heat stress |
| >40 | 0-29 | Severe heat stress |

### 3. VPD Index (Atmospheric Dryness)
**Source**: gridMET weather data
**Resolution**: 4 km daily, aggregated to weekly
**What it measures**: Vapor Pressure Deficit - atmospheric demand for water

**Interpretation**:
- Measures difference between actual and saturated vapor pressure
- High VPD forces stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis
- Optimal VPD for corn: 0.8-1.5 kPa

**VPD Index Thresholds**:
| VPD (kPa) | Index Score | Plant Response |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| <1.0 | 90-100 | Optimal transpiration |
| 1.0-1.5 | 70-89 | Normal stress |
| 1.5-2.0 | 50-69 | Increased stomatal closure |
| 2.0-2.5 | 30-49 | Significant closure |
| >2.5 | 0-29 | Severe atmospheric stress |

### 4. Water Index (Soil Moisture Balance)
**Source**: Derived from ETo (evapotranspiration) and precipitation
**Resolution**: 4 km daily, aggregated to weekly
**What it measures**: Water deficit = ETo - Precipitation

**Interpretation**:
- Negative values indicate water surplus
- Positive values indicate water deficit
- Cumulative deficit through season is key

**Water Index Calculation**:
| Water Deficit (mm/week) | Index Score | Condition |
|------------------------|-------------|-----------|
| <0 (surplus) | 90-100 | Adequate moisture |
| 0-10 | 70-89 | Slight deficit |
| 10-25 | 50-69 | Moderate deficit |
| 25-40 | 30-49 | Significant deficit |
| >40 | 0-29 | Severe drought |

## Composite MCSI Calculation

### Weighting System
The composite MCSI combines individual indices with weights based on growth stage:

**Early Season (Weeks 1-8)**:
- NDVI: 30%
- LST: 20%
- VPD: 20%
- Water: 30%

**Mid-Season/Pollination (Weeks 9-14)**:
- NDVI: 25%
- LST: 30% (heat critical during pollination)
- VPD: 20%
- Water: 25%

**Grain Fill (Weeks 15-22)**:
- NDVI: 35%
- LST: 15%
- VPD: 15%
- Water: 35%

### Formula
```
MCSI = (w_ndvi × NDVI_index) + (w_lst × LST_index) + 
       (w_vpd × VPD_index) + (w_water × Water_index)
```

## Interpreting MCSI Values

### Stress Level Categories

| MCSI Score | Category | Action Required |
|------------|----------|-----------------|
| 80-100 | Healthy | Continue normal management |
| 70-79 | Good | Monitor, no immediate action |
| 50-69 | Mild Stress | Increase monitoring frequency |
| 30-49 | Moderate Stress | Consider intervention |
| 0-29 | Severe Stress | Immediate action needed |

### Response Guidelines

**Severe Stress (MCSI 0-29)**:
1. Check soil moisture immediately
2. Consider emergency irrigation if available
3. Scout for compounding pest/disease issues
4. Begin yield loss assessment
5. Evaluate alternative harvest options (silage)

**Moderate Stress (MCSI 30-49)**:
1. Increase field monitoring frequency
2. Check individual stress components for cause
3. Prepare contingency plans
4. Document affected areas with GPS
5. Contact agronomist for recommendations

**Mild Stress (MCSI 50-69)**:
1. Continue regular monitoring
2. Review long-term weather forecasts
3. Ensure irrigation systems are operational
4. Plan scouting schedule

**Good/Healthy (MCSI 70-100)**:
1. Maintain normal management practices
2. Regular weekly monitoring sufficient
3. Focus on other management priorities

## Anomaly Detection

### Baseline Comparison
MCSI values are compared against climatological baselines (2016-2024 averages) to detect anomalies:

**Anomaly Classification**:
- Normal: Within ±0.5 standard deviations
- Mild Anomaly: ±0.5 to ±1.0 standard deviations
- Moderate Anomaly: ±1.0 to ±2.0 standard deviations
- Severe Anomaly: Beyond ±2.0 standard deviations

### Trend Analysis
Weekly trends indicate whether conditions are:
- Improving: Current week > Previous week
- Stable: Within 5% of previous week
- Declining: Current week < Previous week

## Integration with Yield Forecasting

### MCSI-Yield Relationship
Research has established correlations between MCSI values and final yields:

**Critical Periods for Yield Impact**:
1. Week 10-12 (Pollination): R² = 0.75 with final yield
2. Week 13-16 (Early Grain Fill): R² = 0.82 with final yield
3. Season Average: R² = 0.68 with final yield

### Yield Adjustment Factors
| MCSI During Pollination | Yield Adjustment |
|------------------------|------------------|
| >80 | 100% of potential |
| 60-80 | 90-100% of potential |
| 40-60 | 70-90% of potential |
| 20-40 | 50-70% of potential |
| <20 | <50% of potential |

## Data Quality Notes

### Update Frequency
- Satellite data: Every 8-16 days (cloud-permitting)
- Weather data: Daily, aggregated weekly
- MCSI composite: Weekly during growing season (May-October)

### Limitations
1. Cloud cover can delay satellite updates
2. 500m-1km resolution may miss field-level variation
3. County averages may not reflect individual farm conditions
4. Sensor calibration can vary between satellite passes

### Best Practices for Use
1. Use MCSI as one input among many for decisions
2. Ground-truth with field observations
3. Compare multiple weeks for trend analysis
4. Consider county-specific historical patterns
5. Integrate with local weather station data when available
