# Corn Stress Indicators and Remote Sensing Guide

## Introduction

This guide provides comprehensive information about using remote sensing indicators to monitor corn (Zea mays) crop stress in Iowa. Understanding these indicators is crucial for making timely management decisions and maximizing yield potential.

## Key Remote Sensing Indicators

### 1. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)

**What it measures:** Plant greenness and photosynthetic activity

**Formula:** NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)

**Value ranges:**
- **0.8 - 1.0:** Excellent vegetation health, dense canopy
- **0.7 - 0.8:** Good vegetation health, normal crop development
- **0.5 - 0.7:** Moderate stress, reduced canopy cover
- **0.3 - 0.5:** High stress, sparse vegetation
- **< 0.3:** Severe stress or bare soil

**Interpretation for corn:**
- Peak NDVI typically occurs during tasseling (VT) through early grain fill (R2)
- Healthy Iowa corn fields show NDVI > 0.75 during peak growth
- Rapid decline in NDVI indicates stress or senescence
- Early season NDVI < 0.4 may indicate emergence problems

**Limitations:**
- Saturates at high biomass levels
- Affected by soil background in early season
- Cloud cover can interfere with measurements

### 2. Land Surface Temperature (LST)

**What it measures:** Surface temperature of crop canopy and soil

**Stress indication:**
- Stressed plants have reduced transpiration
- Surface temperature increases when stomata close
- Water-stressed corn shows 3-8°C higher canopy temperature

**Critical thresholds for corn:**
- **< 85°F (29°C):** Optimal temperature range
- **85-95°F (29-35°C):** Heat stress begins
- **95-105°F (35-41°C):** Significant heat stress
- **> 105°F (41°C):** Severe heat stress, potential damage

**Growth stage sensitivity:**
- VT-R1 (tasseling/silking): Most sensitive
- High temperatures (>95°F) during pollination reduce kernel set
- 100°F+ for 3+ days during silking can reduce yield 25-50%

### 3. Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)

**What it measures:** Atmospheric demand for water

**Formula:** VPD = Saturated VP - Actual VP

**Value ranges:**
- **< 1.5 kPa:** Low atmospheric demand
- **1.5 - 2.5 kPa:** Moderate demand, optimal for growth
- **2.5 - 3.5 kPa:** High demand, potential stress
- **> 3.5 kPa:** Very high demand, stress likely

**Impact on corn:**
- High VPD increases transpiration rate
- Corn can close stomata to conserve water
- Sustained high VPD reduces photosynthesis
- Critical during grain fill period

### 4. Evapotranspiration (ET)

**What it measures:** Water loss from crop and soil

**Components:**
- Transpiration: Water loss through plant stomata
- Evaporation: Water loss from soil surface

**Typical corn ET rates (Iowa):**
- Early season (V4-V8): 0.10-0.15 inches/day
- Rapid growth (V12-VT): 0.20-0.25 inches/day
- Peak (VT-R2): 0.25-0.30 inches/day
- Late season (R4-R6): 0.15-0.20 inches/day

**ET anomalies indicate stress:**
- ET < expected: Water stress, reduced transpiration
- ET > expected: High atmospheric demand, potential stress

### 5. Soil Moisture and Water Deficit

**Water balance approach:**
- Precipitation + Irrigation - ET - Runoff - Deep percolation

**Iowa corn water requirements:**
- Season total: 20-25 inches
- Critical period (VT-R3): 8-10 inches
- Daily use at peak: 0.25-0.30 inches

**Water deficit calculation:**
- Cumulative difference between supply and demand
- Deficit > 4 inches: Moderate stress
- Deficit > 8 inches: High stress
- Deficit > 12 inches: Severe stress

## Growth Stage-Specific Stress Impacts

### Early Vegetative (V1-V5)

**Stress impacts:**
- Reduced plant population
- Delayed development
- Smaller plant size
- Yield impact: 5-10%

**Management:**
- Ensure good seed placement
- Monitor emergence uniformly
- Control early season pests

### Rapid Growth (V6-V12)

**Stress impacts:**
- Reduced leaf area development
- Shorter plant height
- Smaller ear size potential
- Yield impact: 10-20%

**Management:**
- Sidedress nitrogen if needed
- Scout for pests (corn borer)
- Monitor soil moisture
- Consider rescue treatments

### Tasseling/Silking (VT-R1) - CRITICAL PERIOD

**Stress impacts:**
- Delayed silk emergence
- Poor pollination
- Kernel abortion
- Yield impact: 40-50%

**Why this period is critical:**
- Pollen shed lasts only 7-10 days
- Silk receptivity window is narrow
- Asynchrony between tasseling and silking
- High temperatures (>95°F) kill pollen
- Water stress during pollination = major yield loss

**Management priorities:**
- Irrigate if possible (highest ROI)
- Do NOT apply herbicides or fungicides
- Monitor daily for stress symptoms
- Document conditions for insurance

### Grain Fill (R2-R5)

**Stress impacts:**
- Reduced kernel weight
- Premature black layer
- Tip-back of ears
- Yield impact: 15-30%

**Management:**
- Continue irrigation if available
- Monitor for disease (gray leaf spot)
- Protect leaf area
- Consider early harvest if severe stress

## Integrated Stress Assessment

### Combining Multiple Indicators

- NDVI > 0.75
- LST < 85°F
- VPD < 2.5 kPa
- ET normal or above normal
- Water deficit < 2 inches
- Management: Routine monitoring

**Moderate Stress (MCSI: 0.3-0.5):**

## Management Recommendations by Stress Level

### Prevention (Before Stress)

1. **Hybrid Selection:**
   - Choose stress-tolerant hybrids for marginal fields
   - Match relative maturity to region
   - Consider drought-tolerant traits

2. **Population Management:**
   - Don't overplant in low-fertility or dryland fields
   - Typical range: 30,000-36,000 plants/acre
   - Reduce population in stress-prone areas

3. **Fertility:**
   - Adequate K for water regulation
   - Proper N management (avoid excess)
   - Consider S and Zn in sandy soils

### Response (During Stress)

1. **Irrigation:**
   - VT-R1: Apply 1.5 inches immediately
   - R2-R4: Apply 1.0-1.5 inches
   - V12-VT: Apply 1.0 inch if severe
   - Late season (R5+): May not be economical

2. **Field Scouting:**
   - Check for leaf rolling (morning = stress)
   - Assess root health if possible
   - Look for secondary issues (pests, disease)

3. **Adjustments:**
   - Delay/cancel herbicide applications
   - Protect leaf area (fungicides if justified)
   - Reduce nutrient applications

### Recovery (After Stress)

1. **Assessment:**
   - Estimate yield loss
   - Document for crop insurance
   - Learn for next season

2. **Salvage:**
   - Consider early harvest if quality degrading
   - Silage option if grain fill failed
   - Evaluate economic return of inputs

3. **Planning:**
   - Tile drainage for wet-prone fields
   - Irrigation infrastructure investment
   - Hybrid selection adjustments
